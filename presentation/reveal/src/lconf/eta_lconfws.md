# Typelead

Company founded to create `eta` and in the future provide commercial support for it



I am not associated with Typelead



Whatever I say or show here are mine own studies. I got help from typelead developers and eta community.

I am neither experienced haskell nor eta developer. 

What I say might be wrong or may not reflect the reality or the future. 

I just try to do my best.
